# AI Train

Python implementation using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, of a football training session planner that picks up the most suitable drills for the team’s match preparation. 
Based on Iterpro’s databases, the performed data analysis considers the past training and game physical workloads, medical statistics and psychological data such as wellness and RPE surveys.

The project was developed in collaboration with NECSTLab, a research laboratory inside DEIB department of Politecnico di Milano, and Iterpro, an Italian company aiming at filling the gap between practice and sports science, in order to turn data into action and help football clubs make better decisions faster.
